Extra Credit:

Instead of only printing "fizz", "buzz", and "fizzbuzz", add a fourth print statement: "prime". 
You should print this whenever you encounter a number that is prime (divisible only by itself and one).
As you implement this, don't worry about the efficiency of the algorithm you use to check for primes. 
It's okay for it to be slow.
